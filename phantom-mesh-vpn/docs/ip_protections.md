## Overview

This document outlines the intellectual property protections for the PhantomMesh VPN project, including proprietary technologies, trade secrets, and licensing terms.

## Proprietary Technologies

### 1. ΣVault Dimensional Scattering

**Status:** Trade Secret / Patent Pending

The ΣVault (Sigma Vault) dimensional scattering algorithm provides:

- 7-dimensional traffic distribution
- Entropy-based scatter proofs
- Temporal rotation mechanics

This technology is protected under trade secret law. Unauthorized disclosure, reverse engineering, or reimplementation is prohibited.

### 2. MNEMONIC Cache System

**Status:** Proprietary

The Multi-Agent Neural Experience Memory with Optimized Sub-Linear Inference for Collectives (MNEMONIC) system implements:

- O(1) threat pattern recall
- Temporal decay with priority elevation
- Cross-agent knowledge sharing
- Reinforcement learning integration

### 3. Elite Agent Architecture

**Status:** Proprietary

The Elite Agent Collective framework, including:

- Agent role definitions and responsibilities
- Orchestration protocols
- Inter-agent communication patterns
- VPN event hook system

## Licensing

### Dual License Model

PhantomMesh VPN operates under a dual license:

#### GPL-3.0 (Open Source)

For non-commercial, personal, and educational use:

- Full source code access
- Modification rights
- Distribution with GPL-3.0 compliance

#### Commercial License

For commercial deployment:

- Proprietary agent clause activation
- Priority support
- Custom feature development
- No copyleft obligations

### Proprietary Agent Clauses

The following components require a commercial license for production use:

1. ΣVault dimensional scattering implementation
2. MNEMONIC cache optimization algorithms
3. Elite Agent coordination protocols
4. Enterprise deployment configurations
