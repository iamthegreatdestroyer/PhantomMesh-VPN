## ⚙️ DECISION GATES (Fully Autonomous)

**Gate 1: Post-Audit (Monday 12 PM)**

```
IF (critical_findings == 0) THEN
  → Proceed to staging deployment
ELSE
  → Automate remediation → Rerun audit → Check again
```

**Gate 2: Post-Load-Test (Tuesday 2 PM)**

```
IF (p99 < 100ms AND error_rate < 0.1%) THEN
  → Proceed to soak test
ELSE
  → Analyze → Identify bottleneck → Optimize → Retest
```

**Gate 3: Pre-Production (Friday 4 PM)**

```
IF (soak_test_passed AND blue_green_ready AND rollback_tested) THEN
  → APPROVE Week 2 deployment
ELSE
  → Fix identified issues → Revalidate
```

**Gate 4-7: Canary Stages (Tuesday 3-5 AM)**

```
Each canary stage:
  IF (error_rate < 0.5% AND latency < 150ms) THEN
    → Proceed to next stage
  ELSE
    → AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK to previous stage
```
